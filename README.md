Basic Bank Transaction APP using MERN Stack

This is a Bank APP that asks for Login and once authenticated brings you to a dashboard where you can make transactions such as deposit and withdrawal. 

There are the CRUD requirements Create user, Read transactions, Update pin, Delete user

there are 3 pages to navigate to login dashboard and view transactions

I styled the app in simple css. Left some to be desired.

I have a User and Transaction model schema

Userroutes with all CRUD for Backend 

Axios used for api calls
